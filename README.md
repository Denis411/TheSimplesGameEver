# TheSimplestGameEver
The project was created for practice

Architecture : 1st screen: MVC + Router, the rest: MVP + Router.

Using MVVM would be possible, however I didn't use reactive programming or SwiftUI, so MVP is okay.
Using VIPER is too boilerplate.

Time: 12 hours

IOS target: 15.2, but might work on 13.0 as well

Localization: EN/RU

Drawbacks: 

1)I did not finish working on keyboard when using on a real device.

2)Landscape layout is buggy.

3)Some minor logic issues.

4)Typos
