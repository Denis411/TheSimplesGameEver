# TheSimplesGameEver
The project was created for practice

Architecture : 1sh screen: MVC + Router, the rest: MVP + Router
Using MVVM would be possible, however I didn't use reactive programming or SwiftUI, so MVP is okay.
Using VIPER is too boilerplate.

Time: 12 hours
IOS target: 15.2, but might work on 13.0 as well
Localization: EN/RU
Drawbacks: I did not fish working with keyboard when using on a real device.
